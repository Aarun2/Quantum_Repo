# Qiskit Tutorials

The files are my code for the Qiskit Online Tutorials. The Jupyter Notebooks are code that will run and produce the right output. Be sure to install qiskit.

The python files include code that worked when I watched the videos and wrote the code.

Qiskit has changed a lot since then and this code does not work as libraries have changed. It is left here for reference.
