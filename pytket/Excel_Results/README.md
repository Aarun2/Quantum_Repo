This folder contains Tokyo_new and Rochester_new. These excel files contain all the data for those architectures. 
tket_size, tket_depth and tket_timing contains the extrapolated data from the files to generate useful graphs.
tokyo_script and rochester_script take the data from tokyo_depth_new.txt, tokyo_count_new.txt, rochester_depth_new.txt and rochester_count_new.txt respectively and add it to the excel file for graph creation.
If you want to generate your own reports and graphs, get data from jupyter file, paste into the corresponding txt file and run the script. Make sure the data is aligned as in the other txt files or edit the script to accomadate that change. Have fun!
