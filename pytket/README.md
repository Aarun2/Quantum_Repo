# Pytket

## Data Generation
Run tket_benchmarking from pytket/examples. It will gennerate data for the chosen architecture: ibmq_20_tokyo and rochester. This will generate data for circuit size in, circuit depth in, circuit size out, circuit depth out, CX gate count out, CX gate depth out and runtime.

## Data Processing
I have added some example excel sheets that I generated and some graphs. The Excel_Results contains scripts I created to parse the data. The Excel_Results readme walks you through generating these reports.
