Run tket_benchmarking from pytket/examples. It will gennerate data for the chosen architecture: ibmqx5, ibmq_20_tokyo and rochester. This will generate data for circuit size in, circuit depth in, circuit size out, circuit depth out, CX gate count out, CX gate depth out and runtime.

I have added some example excel sheets that I generated and some graphs.
